A disclaimer: when it comes to SEO and web marketing, I realize there is a high degree of interest and appeal on the topic. And that between my ownership of firms in that industry and track record, my professional reputation intersects with the topic more than I would prefer. Although I appreciate the consideration, I am not looking to take on that kind of work at this time. And most links you see online suggesting otherwise are not me, they are imposters. If you are looking for pointers and guidance I will work some of that content in here as it arises naturally or adds context to another topic. But Iâ€™m not using this space to sell any services or cheesy e-books, or brand myself as any kind of guru more than I have reluctantly been.
