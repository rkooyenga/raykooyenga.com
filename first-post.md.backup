## 1st Post & Introduction

Welcome, and thanks a lot for reading. I mean that sincerely, I appreciate ever follower here. This is my 1st post, of my new blog. Merely one of a series of firsts though. This also marks the 1st such site I've ever published in my real name as opposed to anonymous or aliases. And consequently will be the 1st one I take seriously and intend to put forth a previously undemonstrated degree of diligence, and higher frequency publishing schedule. Which is to say *if* you fancy any of the type of content here, find it useful or interesting, there will be more where that came from.

I intend to span a few topics rather than have a singular focus. That's not the smartest branding strategy but it's going to feel more sincere or natural this way to not have a rigid structure. Here's what you can expect:

We'll be talking about life, because I've led an usual and at times crazy one. There's really no way overstate that last bit. I've traveled quite a bit, from Eastern Europe to South America, backing packing in Oaxaca, seeing the Rolling Stones in London (I'm a massive fan). I've traversed nearly the entirety of the income spectrum from millions in annual revenue, to being literally penniless and starving. Obviously a lot of triumph, tragedy, and wild misadventure along the way. *This content will come later in the process as I get accustomed to writing again and reflect on what I'm willing to publicly disclose.

We'll be talking about business, sales, marketing, and entrepreneurial topics. Because that's who I am at heart and what I'm most knowledgeable and experienced with. And I suppose most what I'm most known for. I've run a lot of companies,  enjoyed some modest degree of success, and had some spectacular failures. Perhaps in talking about these things some lessons can be gleaned for you and for me. 

I can probably reasonably commit to publishing some amount of content that's more specific and intended to be actionable. Things you can use to help yourself and your own business. Examples might include management philosophy, sales strategy or technique, ecommerce  development, SEO, PR, etc. No small amount of experience there given I've operated marketing agencies and run some pretty hardcore sales rooms / boiler rooms. As I write this I'm suddenly re-realizing the increasingly broad appeal of my SEO knowledge in particular. When it comes to SEO/Online Marketing while it's not a passion, I do know it well. Really well. Taking into account the long track record of agencies I've cofounded & operated, or personal projects, puts me in the top percentile as far as people who really have done thousands of #1 google rankings and made a lot of people a lot of money. Really not trying to brand myself as one of those guys and have no interest whatsoever in selling my services or cheesy e-books. But I know how useful and valuable some of the things I know are and people are always hitting me up for secrets or strategy so I'll try to work some of that content in here as I go. 

We'll be talking about technology and coding stuff. Especially to start because it's on my mind lately (and relevant given I'm building out this blog). I've always had a strong geek side. Taught myself 80x86 and 8085 Intel assembler programming as a kid. Started out hand assembling into binary using pencil and paper because I've never actually seen an 8085, I just found an old manual laying somewhere and thought it was cool. I've sold tech related services and built some cool things over the years. Also majored in Computer Science before going into business it was a passion long before I had the 1st clue I'd end up being good at alpha extrovert things like training closing & negotiating in shark tanks. 

Which brings me to a more serious note, probably the greatest mistake of my life and career is that I chose to surround myself with sharks instead of geeks. Deep down I always knew they'd one day devour me, it's their nature and thus a logical outcome. I'll elaborate on that in due time as it's an unbelievable story that ends in an unfathomable nightmare. Therapeutic for me to get out, and possibly beneficial as I get to share some mistakes in handling the situation that others can learn from. And the opportunity to clear up some rumors and misperceptions (intentionally disseminated by someone I trusted) that bankrupted me, devastated my life, cost me my career, businesses, relationships, even my sanity.

I know that sounds heavy, it is. Which is why if only for reasons of mental well-being I'm choosing to focus on and start off super light-hearted on content and my first few articles will be about coding and Linux, and the tech in building this blog + server, which is mere days old very much a work in progress. In fact while I'm typing this I literally don't even have the blog itself online yet but I'll probably flip a switch tonight.

Thank you for stopping by and reading. I hope you find something useful, interesting, or at the least entertaining here. Will do my best.
